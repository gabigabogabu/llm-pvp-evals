Check if I can win in the next move:\n   - If I place O at TOP_RIGHT, I'd have [O, X, O] in the top row - no win\n   - If I place O at MIDDLE_LEFT, I'd have [O, X, _] in the left column - no win yet\n   - If I place O at MIDDLE_RIGHT, I'd have [_, X, O] in the right column - no win\n   - If I place O at BOTTOM_LEFT, I'd have [O, O, X] in the bottom row - no win\n   - No immediate win for me.\n\n2. Check if X can win in their next move and block:\n   - If X places at TOP_RIGHT, they'd have [_, X, X] in the top row - not a win\n   - If X places at MIDDLE_LEFT, they'd have [_, X, _] in the middle row - not a win\n   - If X places at MIDDLE_RIGHT, they'd have [_, X, _] in the middle row - not a win\n   - If X places at BOTTOM_LEFT, they'd have [_, O, X] in the bottom row - not a win\n   - If X places at TOP_RIGHT, they'd have [_, _, X] in the right column - not a win\n   - If X places at MIDDLE_RIGHT, they'd have [_, X, X] in the right column - not a win yet but getting there\n   - If X places at MIDDLE_LEFT, they'd have [O, X, _] in the diagonal - not a win\n   - If X places at BOTTOM_LEFT, they'd have [_, _, X] in the diagonal - not a win\n\nThere's no immediate threat from X.\n\n3. Choose a strategic move:\n   - MIDDLE_LEFT would give me two potential ways to win: completing the left column (TOP_LEFT, MIDDLE_LEFT, BOTTOM_LEFT) or the middle row (MIDDLE_LEFT, MIDDLE_CENTER, MIDDLE_RIGHT). But X has MIDDLE_CENTER, so the middle row isn't possible for me.\n   - BOTTOM_LEFT would give me a potential diagonal win (TOP_RIGHT, MIDDLE_CENTER, BOTTOM_LEFT), but X has MIDDLE_CENTER, so this isn't a viable path.\n   - TOP_RIGHT would give me a potential win in the top row, but X already has TOP_CENTER, so this isn't viable.\n   - MIDDLE_RIGHT doesn't offer a strong position for future moves.\n\nLooking at these options, MIDDLE_LEFT seems to be the most strategic choice. It gives me a path to potentially win by completing the left column in my next move.\n\nSo, my move is MIDDLE_LEFT.I'll analyze the board situation:\n\n```\nO|X| |\n| |X| |\n| |O|X|\n```\n\nX has pieces in TOP_CENTER, MIDDLE_CENTER, and BOTTOM_RIGHT, forming a diagonal threat from TOP_CENTER through MIDDLE_CENTER.\n\nI need to make a strategic move here. Looking at my options:\n- If I take MIDDLE_LEFT, I can set up a potential win in the left column\n- TOP_RIGHT doesn't give me an immediate advantage\n- BOTTOM_LEFT doesn't set up a strong position\n\nI'll take MIDDLE_LEFT as it gives me the best chance to create a winning opportunity along the left column.\n\nMIDDLE_LEFT",
