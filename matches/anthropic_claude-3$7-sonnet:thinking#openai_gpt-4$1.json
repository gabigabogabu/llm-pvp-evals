After that, I need to look for opportunities to create a winning line or a fork.\n\nSo, my move is TOP_CENTER.I need to block the opponent immediately!

Let me evaluate the open positions:\n\n- MIDDLE_RIGHT\n- BOTTOM_LEFT\n- BOTTOM_CENTER\n\nLooking at the current board, I notice:\n1. I have X at TOP_CENTER, MIDDLE_CENTER, and BOTTOM_RIGHT forming a diagonal line from top-center to bottom-right.\n2. O has pieces at TOP_LEFT, TOP_RIGHT, and MIDDLE_LEFT.\n\nLet me check for any immediate winning moves:\n- If I place at MIDDLE_RIGHT, I would have a line in the middle row (MIDDLE_LEFT, MIDDLE_CENTER, MIDDLE_RIGHT). But wait, MIDDLE_LEFT is actually taken by O, so this isn't a winning move.\n- If I place at BOTTOM_LEFT, I would have a diagonal from BOTTOM_LEFT to TOP_RIGHT. But I need to check if that works - I would have (BOTTOM_LEFT, MIDDLE_CENTER, TOP_RIGHT). But TOP_RIGHT is taken by O, so this isn't a winning move either.\n\nLet me check if O has any threatening positions I need to block:\n- If O plays at MIDDLE_RIGHT, they would have (TOP_RIGHT, MIDDLE_RIGHT, BOTTOM_RIGHT). No, that doesn't work because BOTTOM_RIGHT is taken by X.\n- If O plays at BOTTOM_LEFT, they would have (TOP_LEFT, MIDDLE_LEFT, BOTTOM_LEFT) forming a column on the left. This is a threat!\n- If O plays at BOTTOM_CENTER, they would have (TOP_CENTER, MIDDLE_CENTER, BOTTOM_CENTER). No, that doesn't work because MIDDLE_CENTER is taken by X.\n\nI see that O has a potential winning move at BOTTOM_LEFT. I need to block this by placing my X at BOTTOM_LEFT.\n\nMy move: BOTTOM_LEFTI need to play strategically here. Looking at the board:\n\n```\nO | X | O\nO | X | _\n_ | _ | X\n```\n\nI notice O has two pieces in the left column (TOP_LEFT and MIDDLE_LEFT), creating an immediate threat. If I don't block at BOTTOM_LEFT, O will win on their next move.\n\nAdditionally, placing my X at BOTTOM_LEFT will give me two pieces in a diagonal (BOTTOM_LEFT, MIDDLE_CENTER) with a potential third at TOP_RIGHT, though that's currently blocked.\n\nMy move: BOTTOM_LEFT",
