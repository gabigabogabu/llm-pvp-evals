My opponent now has O in both MIDDLE_RIGHT and TOP_RIGHT, forming a partial line in the right column.\n\nLet me think about my strategy:\n1. Check for any immediate winning moves - none yet\n2. Block any potential winning moves by my opponent:\n   - My opponent has O in TOP_RIGHT and MIDDLE_RIGHT\n   - If they get BOTTOM_RIGHT, they'll have a vertical winning line\n   - So I should consider blocking BOTTOM_RIGHT\n3. Create opportunities for future winning lines\n\nI have X in TOP_LEFT and MIDDLE_CENTER. I could pursue several strategies:\n- If I take BOTTOM_LEFT, I'd create a potential winning line in the left column\n- If I take BOTTOM_RIGHT, I'd block my opponent's potential win and create a diagonal opportunity for myself\n- If I take MIDDLE_LEFT, I'd start building toward a middle row win\n\nIn this case, the most urgent move is to block my opponent's potential winning move in the right column by taking BOTTOM_RIGHT.\n\nBut wait - let me also consider if there are better offensive moves. If I take BOTTOM_LEFT, I'd have two positions on a potential winning diagonal (TOP_RIGHT to BOTTOM_LEFT), but this diagonal already has an O in it, so I can't win that way.\n\nI think the best move is to take BOTTOM_RIGHT, which both blocks my opponent's potential winning line and gives me the possibility of completing the diagonal from TOP_LEFT to BOTTOM_RIGHT.Looking at the current board:\n```\nX| |O\n-+-+-\n |X|O\n-+-+-\n | |  \n```\n\nI notice my opponent now has two Os in the right column (TOP_RIGHT and MIDDLE_RIGHT). This creates a potential threat - if they get BOTTOM_RIGHT on their next move, they'll win with a vertical line.\n\nI need to block this immediate threat while continuing to develop my position. By taking BOTTOM_RIGHT, I'll:\n1. Block my opponent's potential winning move in the right column\n2. Create my own diagonal opportunity from TOP_LEFT through MIDDLE_CENTER to BOTTOM_RIGHT\n\nThis is clearly the best strategic move in this position.\n\nBOTTOM_RIGHT\nI took BOTTOM_RIGHT",
