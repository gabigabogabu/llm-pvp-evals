      "content": "\nOkay, I need to figure out the best move for X in this Tic Tac Toe game. The board is completely empty right since it's the first move. The user mentioned all positions are open. The traditional first move in Tic Tac Toe is usually the center, which is MIDDLE_CENTER here. Taking the center gives the most opportunities for creating lines in all directions. Alternatively, a corner like TOP_LEFT is also a strong opening. Let me think. If I choose the center, the opponent might take a corner, but that's manageable. If I take a corner, the opponent might take the center. But statistically, the center is the best first move. So I should go with MIDDLE_CENTER. Let me confirm the exact name of the field. The user listed MIDDLE_CENTER as one of the options. So the correct response would be to select MIDDLE_CENTER. That's the optimal starting move.\nThe optimal first move in T Tac Toe is the center. By taking **MIDDLE_CENTER**, you maximize your chances of creating winning lines in all directions. This strategic position allows flexibility for future moves and limits your opponent's options. \n\n**Move:** MIDDLE_CENTER  \n**Response:**  \n```xml\n<tic-tac-toe>\n  <MIDDLE_CENTER>X</MIDDLE_CENTER>\n</tic-tac-toe>\n```",
