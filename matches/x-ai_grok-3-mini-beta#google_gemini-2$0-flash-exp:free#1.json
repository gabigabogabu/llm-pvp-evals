The system prompt says: \"You play by responding with the field you want to take. The last field you mention will be taken as your move.\"\n\nSo, my response should end with the field I want to play in.\n\nIn Tic Tac Toe, as X, I go first. A good strategy is to take the center or a corner, as those are strong positions.\n\nThe fields are:\n\n- TOP_LEFT\n\n- TOP_CENTER\n\n- TOP_RIGHT\n\n- MIDDLE_LEFT\n\n- MIDDLE_CENTER\n\n- MIDDLE_RIGHT\n\n- BOTTOM_LEFT\n\n- BOTTOM_CENTER\n\n- BOTTOM_RIGHT\n\nThe center is MIDDLE_CENTER, which is a great first move because it gives the most options.\n\nI could choose a corner like TOP_LEFT.\n\nTo play optimally, I'll go with MIDDLE_CENTER.\n\nMy response should mention the field, and the last one I mention will be the move. So, I can say something like: \"I think I'll take the center. So, my move is MIDDLE_CENTER.\"\n\nThat way, the last field mentioned is MIDDLE_CENTER.\n\nFinally, end my response with that.I see the board is completely empty, which gives me a great opportunity as X to start strong. I'll aim for the center, as it's a central position that offers the most flexibility. My move is MIDDLE_CENTER.",
