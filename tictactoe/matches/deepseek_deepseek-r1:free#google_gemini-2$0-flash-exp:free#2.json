I remember that the best opening move is usually the center because it gives the most opportunities to create lines. But sometimes people start with a corner. Let me think.\n\nIf I take the center, MIDDLE_CENTER, then I can potentially create lines in all directions. That seems strong. But maybe the opponent will go for a corner. Wait, but since it's the first move, maybe the center is the best choice. Yeah, I think I'll go with MIDDLE_CENTER. That way, no matter where the opponent goes, I can block or create threats from the center. Let me confirm. Yeah, the center is a solid first move. So my move should be MIDDLE_CENTER.\nMIDDLE_CENTER",
