Let's analyze the current board:\n\n```\nO |   |   \n---------\n  | X |   \n---------\nO |   | X\n```\n\nThe opponent (X) has just placed their mark in MIDDLE_RIGHT. So the board now looks like:\n\n```\nO |   |   \n---------\n  | X | X\n---------\nO |   | X\n```\n\nI need to decide where to place my next O. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. X has pieces at MIDDLE_CENTER, MIDDLE_RIGHT, and BOTTOM_RIGHT\n2. I have pieces at TOP_LEFT and BOTTOM_LEFT\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- X has two marks in the middle row (MIDDLE_CENTER and MIDDLE_RIGHT), so they could win by placing in MIDDLE_LEFT\n- X has marks in BOTTOM_RIGHT and MIDDLE_RIGHT, forming a potential line that could be completed at TOP_RIGHT\n- X has a diagonal from MIDDLE_CENTER to BOTTOM_RIGHT, but I've already blocked the TOP_LEFT spot in that diagonal\n\nI need to block one of these threats. The most immediate appears to be the middle row, where X has two out of three positions. I should place my O in MIDDLE_LEFT to block this threat.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about creating my own winning opportunity. I already have O in TOP_LEFT and BOTTOM_LEFT, so placing in MIDDLE_LEFT would give me a potential win in the left column.\n\nSo either for defensive or offensive reasons, MIDDLE_LEFT seems like the best move.\n\nActually, let me double-check what the open fields are according to the prompt:\nOpen fields: TOP_CENTER, TOP_RIGHT, MIDDLE_LEFT, BOTTOM_CENTER\n\nSo my analysis is correct and MIDDLE_LEFT is an available move. I'll choose that position.I need to block X's developing strategy. Looking at the board:\n\n```\nO |   |   \n---------\n  | X | X\n---------\nO |   | X\n```\n\nX has placed their mark in MIDDLE_RIGHT, creating two potential threats:\n1. A win across the middle row (MIDDLE_LEFT, MIDDLE_CENTER, MIDDLE_RIGHT)\n2. A diagonal from TOP_RIGHT through MIDDLE_RIGHT to BOTTOM_RIGHT\n\nI should block the more immediate threat, which is the middle row. Additionally, by placing my O in MIDDLE_LEFT, I'll be setting up my own winning opportunity along the left column, where I already have marks in TOP_LEFT and BOTTOM_LEFT.\n\nI choose MIDDLE_LEFT.",
