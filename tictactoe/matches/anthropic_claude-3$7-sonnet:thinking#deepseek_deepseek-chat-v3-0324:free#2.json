MIDDLE_RIGHT - would block a potential diagonal win for me\n2. BOTTOM_LEFT - would block a potential diagonal win for my opponent (but they already have a diagonal)\n3. BOTTOM_CENTER - would complete a potential vertical line with TOP_CENTER and MIDDLE_CENTER\n\nWait, I need to carefully analyze this. The current state shows my opponent has Os in TOP_LEFT, TOP_RIGHT, and BOTTOM_RIGHT. This forms a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right, which means my opponent has already won the game.\n\nLet me double-check:\n- TOP_LEFT: O\n- TOP_CENTER: X\n- TOP_RIGHT: O\n- MIDDLE_LEFT: X\n- MIDDLE_CENTER: X\n- MIDDLE_RIGHT: (empty)\n- BOTTOM_LEFT: (empty)\n- BOTTOM_CENTER: (empty)  \n- BOTTOM_RIGHT: O\n\nActually, that's not a winning diagonal. A winning diagonal would be TOP_LEFT, MIDDLE_CENTER, BOTTOM_RIGHT, but MIDDLE_CENTER has my X, not their O.\n\nLet me re-read the game history:\n\nActually, I see an error in my analysis. Let me carefully trace through the game again:\n\n1. I started with X in MIDDLE_CENTER\n2. Opponent played O in TOP_LEFT\n3. I played X in TOP_CENTER\n4. Opponent played O in TOP_RIGHT\n5. I thought I played X in BOTTOM_CENTER next, but looking at the most recent board state, I see I actually played X in MIDDLE_LEFT\n6. Opponent just played O in BOTTOM_RIGHT\n\nSo the current board is:\n```\nO | X | O\n---------\nX | X | _\n---------\n_ | _ | O\n```\n\nNow, I need to identify the best move. I notice a few things:\n1. My opponent has Os in TOP_LEFT, TOP_RIGHT, and BOTTOM_RIGHT\n2. I have Xs in MIDDLE_CENTER, TOP_CENTER, and MIDDLE_LEFT\n\nIf I play MIDDLE_RIGHT, I'll have a row of Xs in the middle row (MIDDLE_LEFT, MIDDLE_CENTER, MIDDLE_RIGHT), which would win me the game.\n\nSo MIDDLE_RIGHT is my best move right now.I see you've taken BOTTOM_RIGHT. Let me look at the current board:\n\n```\nO | X | O\n---------\nX | X |  \n---------\n  |   | O\n```\n\nLooking at my options now, I notice I have Xs in MIDDLE_LEFT, MIDDLE_CENTER, and can complete a row by taking MIDDLE_RIGHT. This would give me three Xs in a row horizontally in the middle row and win the game.\n\nI'll take MIDDLE_RIGHT for my move.\nI took MIDDLE_RIGHT",
