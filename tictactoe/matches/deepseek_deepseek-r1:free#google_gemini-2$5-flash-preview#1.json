      "content": "**Response**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best move for X in this Tic Tac Toe game. The board is completely empty right now, which means it's the first move. Let me recall the standard strategies for Tic Tac Toe. The best first move is usually the center because it gives the most opportunities to create lines. If I take the center, I can then set up potential wins in the rows, columns, and diagonals. Alternatively, the corners are also good, but the center is generally considered optimal. Let me confirm: the center is MIDDLE_CENTER. So I should choose that. Let me make sure the system will recognize it correctly. The user mentioned the fields as MIDDLE_CENTER. Yes, that's the center. So the response should be to take MIDDLE_CENTER. I'll write that as the move.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Assess the Board:** The board is empty; it's the first move.\n2. **Optimal Strategy:** The best first move in Tic Tac Toe is the center (MIDDLE_CENTER) for maximum strategic advantage.\n3. **Select Move:** Choose MIDDLE_CENTER to control the center and create multiple winning possibilities.\n\n**Formatted Answer:**\n\nThe optimal first move is the center. \n\n<move>MIDDLE_CENTER</move>\nThe optimal first move is the center. \n\n<move>MIDDLE_CENTER</move>",
